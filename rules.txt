Section One
Violation of this server will get you warned, kicked, banned depending on the severity.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. HAVE A LIFE
We do not allow abusive, harmful, etc. content in this server. Keep it SFW, please, or you will be banned. This includes usernames and avatars.

2. NO SPAMMING/BOT COMMANDS (other than #ü§ñ-bot-general)
As everyone knows, spamming is fun when you're the one hitting the keyboard like a maniac, but please, be considerate of others. Also, no repeated text. Put bot commands in #ü§ñ-bot-general only, there's a reason it exists

3. NO CURSING
We understand that everybody argues and gets mad at each other, but please don't curse on this server. (The exception is #üá∫üá∏-politics)

4. STAY ON TOPIC
This isn't too enforced, but just remember that we didn't make this server for political arguments (#üá∫üá∏-politics is the only place that's allowed)

5. DONT PING @everyone OR @here WITHOUT A REASON
Look, we know pings are bad. People hate them. So, reduce the amount of pings mods. This applies to you.

6. SELF-PROMO IN #üíµ-promo ONLY
Look, this should be straightforward. Only promote in #üíµ-promo. Outside of that is very annoying and can split and divide up conversations. No DM advertising either.

7. RESPECT OTHER MEMBERS
Basically, don't be a racist.

8. USERNAME GUIDELINES
Being able to change your own username is a priviledge and SHOULD NOT BE ABUSED.
Your username should not resemble a staff member's username. Keep it SFW, and English only please.
 
Section Two
Violation of this section may get you warned or muted.

1. No pinging Staff Members (mods, owner, devs) WITHOUT permission, or if they haven‚Äôt talked in the last 15 minutes. (staff excluded from this)
2. Only English
3. Keep converstion in #üì∑-pix to a minimum; only reason you should be using text there is to react to the picture and critique it.
4. Do not use the @[>] Admin Radio UNLESS YOU ARE STAFF.
5. Bot commands should go in #ü§ñ-bot-general only
6. Idle Miner goes in #‚õè-idle-miner instead of #ü§ñ-bot-general 
7. /tts should NOT BE USED WITH EMOJI. It's very annoying.
8. Do not initiate giveaways unless you are staff.
9. Don't use excessive caps or emoji.
 
Punishment system
Temp mute for 1 hour when you have more than 4+ warnings from mods/MEE6 in the last 3 hrs 
Mute when you have more than 6+ warnings from mods/MEE6 in under 6 hrs 
Kick when you have 3+ infractions in under an hour
Ban if you have 3+ warnings in the last half an hour.

IF A RULE IS NOT LISTED HERE, USE COMMON SENSE TO KNOW IF YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN‚ÄôT DO IT
